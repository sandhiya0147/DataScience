## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:

### 1. Classification

- **Decision Trees** – [Decision Tree Repo](https://github.com/sandhiya0147/Iris-flower-prediction)  
- **Random Forest** – [Random Forest Repo](https://github.com/sandhiya0147/amazon-sales-prediction)  
- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)** – [SVM Repo](https://github.com/sandhiya0147/Student-Depression-Detection-App)  
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** – [KNN Repo](https://github.com/ghimiresunil/Scratch-implementation-of-KNN)  
- **Logistic Regression** – [Logistic Regression Repo](https://github.com/sandhiya0147/placement-predictor-app)  
- **Naive Bayes** – [Naive Bayes Repo](https://github.com/sandhiya0147/Fake-news-detector-app)  
- **Gradient Boosting** – [Gradient Boosting Repo](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost)

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning uses **unlabeled data** to find patterns and relationships.

### 1. Clustering

- **K-Means** – [K-Means Repo](https://github.com/sandhiya0147/netflix)  
- **Hierarchical Clustering** – [Hierarchical Clustering Repo](https://github.com/topics/hierarchical-clustering)  
- **DBSCAN** – [DBSCAN Repo](https://github.com/topics/dbscan)

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** – [PCA Repo](https://github.com/topics/principal-component-analysis)
